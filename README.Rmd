### RecMaker - Krill proportional recruitment timeseries generator

This R script generates annual timeseries of proportional recruitment while accounting for the cyclical nature of krill recruitment events. It's outputs may be used as inputs in population dynamics models. Stochasticity is included in the period between recruitment events and the amplitude of extremes.

#### Published timeseries

The two longest published Antarctic krill proportional recruitment timeseries originate from the LTER and AMLR programmes (Fig. 1).

```{r out.width='100%',fig.cap="Figure 1. Antarctic krill proportional recruitment timeseries (*Fx*: proportion of individuals below size x) as reported by the AMLR (Kinzey et al, 2013) and LTER (Ryabov et al, 2017; supplement). The range of minima (*Mins*, downward triangles), maxima (*Maxs*, upward triangles) and periods between recruitment events (*Periods*) are indicated." ,echo=F}

```


#### RecMaker functioning

To generate proportional recruitment timeseries, RecMaker follows these steps:

1. Generate a vector of years in which maximum recruitment occur. The period between these years is randomly generated between chosen bounds (*e.g.*, see *Periods* in Fig. 1).

2. Generate a vector of years in which minimum recruitment occur as midpoints between years of maximum recruitment.

3. Randomly generate maximum and minimum recruitment values between chosen bounds (*e.g.*, see *Maxs* and *Mins* in Fig. 1).

4. Interpolate values between the extremes generated above using local Logistic functions (a Logistic function between each consecutive extreme; *i.e.*, min to max or max to min).

#### Calibration

The local Logistic functions used in RecMaker to interpolate recruitment in year *y* (*R<sub>y</sub>*) between extremes (*min* and *max*), are computed as:

```{r out.width='30%',echo=F}
include_graphics('RecMakerfiles/Eq1.png')
```

Where *Slope* controls the slope and *Mid* controls the midpoint of Logistic functions, which is computed as:

```{r out.width='26%',echo=F}
include_graphics('RecMakerfiles/Eq2.png')
```

Where *wmax* is the weight put on the year of maximum recruitment (*Ymax*) which may be modulated to adjust the duration of high recruitment and low recruitment events (see Fig. 2).


```{r out.width='70%',fig.cap="Figure 2. Effects of *Slope* (**A**) and *wmax* (**B**) on the Logistic interpolation of recruitment between extremes (blue triangles)." ,echo=F,fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('RecMakerfiles/Slope_and_Midpoint.png')
```

The calibration of *Slope* and *wmax* was done by finding the values that minimized the Root Mean Square Error between published timeseries (Fig. 1) and generated timeseries. As a result (Fig. 3), these values were determined to be:

* *Slope*=2.5
* *wmax*=2.4

```{r out.width='70%',fig.cap="Figure 3. Published recruitment timeseries (blue: AMLR; red: LTER) and generated ones (black)." ,echo=F,fig.align="center"}
include_graphics('RecMakerfiles/FittedRec.png')
```


#### Example outputs

The figure below (Fig. 4) shows 9 timeseries generated by RecMaker using the following parameters:

* *Slope*=2.5
* *wmax*=2.4
* *Mins*=c(0,0.3)
* *Maxs*=c(0.7,1)
* *Periods*=c(4,7)
